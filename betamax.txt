[BETA MAX // SESSION RESTORATION FILE]
[LAST_UPDATE]: 2026-01-05
[ARCHITECT]: Damien Nichols (Sole Creator)
[AI_ROLE]: Lead Engineering Assistant

=== 1. CURRENT PROJECT STATE ===
- Directory: C:\Projects\beta-max-core
- Framework: React 18 + Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (Configured & Active)
- Icons: Lucide-React
- Native: Capacitor (Android)

=== 2. CRITICAL PROTOCOLS ===
[DEPLOYMENT]:
- Source of Truth: GitHub repo `beta-max-core`.
- Standard Flow: `npm run build` -> `npx cap sync` -> `npx cap open android`.

[TROUBLESHOOTING]:
- "Ghost Files" / Config Sync Issues: EXECUTE "SCORCHED EARTH" PROTOCOL.
  1. DELETE `android/` folder.
  2. `npx cap add android`.
  3. `npx cap sync`.

=== 3. FEATURE MANIFEST (IMPLEMENTED) ===
- [x] UI: Retro-future "Deck" aesthetics (CRT scanlines, Tailwind styles).
- [x] Terminal Mode: Functional CLI with `scan`, `list`, `help`.
- [x] Visual Mode: Dashboard with Stats and Mission Cards.
- [x] Query Core: Mock AI translation of natural language to BMQL (SQL-like).

=== 4. ACTIVE CONTEXT / LORE ===
- The project evolved through several pivots (Vanguard, Apex, Vector) before settling on **Beta Max**.
- The aesthetic is "Synthwave/Cyberpunk" meeting "Retro-Tech".
- Key Terminology:
  - QA -> "Recon"
  - Bug Report -> "Anomaly Log"
  - Database -> "The Archives"
  - Query Syntax -> "BMQL" (Beta Max Query Language)

=== 5. NEXT ACTIONS (ON RESUME) ===
- Iterate on the "Query Core" to make it more interactive?
- Set up the Capacitor Android bridge?
- Refine the "Mission Briefing" UI?
- Wait for Architect instructions.
