[BETA MAX // SESSION RESTORATION FILE]
[LAST_UPDATE]: 2026-01-06
[ARCHITECT]: Damien Nichols (Sole Creator)
[AI_ROLE]: Lead Engineering Assistant

=== 1. CURRENT PROJECT STATE ===
- Directory: C:\Projects\beta-max-core
- Framework: Native Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- Gradle: 8.11 (Downgraded from 9.0-m1 for stability)
- Kotlin: 2.0.0 (Compose Compiler Plugin active)
- SDK: Compile/Target 35 (Required by AndroidX Core 1.15.0)
- UI: Jetpack Compose (Cyberpunk / Retro-future aesthetic)
- Data: Room Database (Mission entity implemented)

=== 2. CRITICAL PROTOCOLS ===
[DEPLOYMENT]:
- Standard Flow: `./gradlew assembleDebug` -> `adb install` -> `adb shell am start`.
- Artifacts: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
- Package ID: `com.betamax.core`.

[TROUBLESHOOTING]:
- AAPT Errors: Ensure `mipmap` and `drawable` resources exist for icons.
- Kapt/Kotlin 2.0: Kapt falls back to 1.9 but works for Room.

=== 3. FEATURE MANIFEST (IMPLEMENTED) ===
- [x] Portal: Firebase Auth (Email + Google) & Firestore integration.
- [x] Portal: Role-based Onboarding (Tester/Scout vs Developer/Architect).
- [x] Portal: Firebase Security Rules (Role-based access control).
- [x] Portal: Cyberpunk/Retro-future responsive UI (React 19 + Tailwind 4).
- [x] UI: Retro-future "Deck" aesthetics (CRT scanlines, Tailwind styles).
- [x] Portal: Scout Qualification test engine.
- [x] Portal: Architect's App (Mission) Registration flow.
- [x] Portal: "External Betas" flow (Community-sourced missions).
- [x] Portal: GitHub Issues export for Anomaly Logs.
- [x] App: Firebase Integration (Firestore missions fetch).
- [x] App: UI support for OFFICIAL vs COMMUNITY missions.
- [x] App: Device Recon (Local scan for beta apps + Play Store intel scraping).
- [x] Firestore: Tier-based security rules for missions.

=== 4. ACTIVE CONTEXT / LORE ===
- The project evolved through several pivots (Vanguard, Apex, Vector) before settling on **Beta Max**.
- The aesthetic is "Synthwave/Cyberpunk" meeting "Retro-Tech".
- Key Terminology:
  - QA -> "Recon"
  - Bug Report -> "Anomaly Log"
  - Database -> "The Archives"
  - Query Syntax -> "BMQL" (Beta Max Query Language)

=== 5. NEXT ACTIONS (ON RESUME) ===
- [ ] Implement "Enrollment" logic in the portal and app (Scouts joining missions).
- [ ] Build the "Anomaly Log" (Bug Report) submission flow in the app.
- [ ] Create a "Leaderboard" or "Scout Hall of Fame" in the portal.
- [ ] Integrate BMQL (Beta Max Query Language) parser for advanced mission filtering.
- [ ] Build up "Recon" capabilities to include automatic enrollment detection.
