[BETA MAX // SESSION RESTORATION FILE]
[LAST_UPDATE]: 2026-01-06
[ARCHITECT]: Damien Nichols (Sole Creator)
[AI_ROLE]: Lead Engineering Assistant

=== 1. CURRENT PROJECT STATE ===
- Directory: C:\Projects\beta-max-core
- Framework: Native Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- Gradle: 8.11 (Downgraded from 9.0-m1 for stability)
- Kotlin: 2.0.0 (Compose Compiler Plugin active)
- SDK: Compile/Target 35 (Required by AndroidX Core 1.15.0)
- UI: Jetpack Compose (Cyberpunk / Retro-future aesthetic)
- Data: Room Database (Mission entity implemented)

=== 2. CRITICAL PROTOCOLS ===
[DEPLOYMENT]:
- Standard Flow: `./gradlew assembleDebug` -> `adb install` -> `adb shell am start`.
- Artifacts: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
- Package ID: `com.betamax.core`.

[TROUBLESHOOTING]:
- AAPT Errors: Ensure `mipmap` and `drawable` resources exist for icons.
- Kapt/Kotlin 2.0: Kapt falls back to 1.9 but works for Room.

=== 3. FEATURE MANIFEST (IMPLEMENTED) ===
- [x] UI: Retro-future "Deck" aesthetics (CRT scanlines, Tailwind styles).
- [x] Terminal Mode: Functional CLI with `scan`, `list`, `help`.
- [x] Visual Mode: Dashboard with Stats and Mission Cards.
- [x] Query Core: Mock AI translation of natural language to BMQL (SQL-like).

=== 4. ACTIVE CONTEXT / LORE ===
- The project evolved through several pivots (Vanguard, Apex, Vector) before settling on **Beta Max**.
- The aesthetic is "Synthwave/Cyberpunk" meeting "Retro-Tech".
- Key Terminology:
  - QA -> "Recon"
  - Bug Report -> "Anomaly Log"
  - Database -> "The Archives"
  - Query Syntax -> "BMQL" (Beta Max Query Language)

=== 5. NEXT ACTIONS (ON RESUME) ===
- Iterate on the "Query Core" to make it more interactive?
- Set up the Capacitor Android bridge?
- Refine the "Mission Briefing" UI?
- Wait for Architect instructions.
