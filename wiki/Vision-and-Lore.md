# Vision & Lore

Beta Max isn't just a bug tracker; it's a **cyberpunk reality** where code is currency and quality is rank.

## The Aesthetic
The UI is built with a **"Dark Mode First"** philosophy, heavily inspired by:
*   **Synthwave & Cyberpunk**: Neon glows, CRT scanlines, monospaced fonts.
*   **Retro-Tech**: Terminal interfaces, cassette tape motifs (hence "Beta Max").
*   **High Contrast**: Designed for late-night coding sessions.

## Terminology
We don't use standard industry terms. We use **The Language of the Deck**:

| Standard Term | Beta Max Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **QA / Testing** | **Recon** | The act of exploring an app to find issues. |
| **Bug Report** | **Anomaly Log** | A documented issue or glitch found during Recon. |
| **Developer** | **Architect** | The creator of the software being tested. |
| **Tester** | **Scout** | A user who hunts for anomalies. |
| **Database** | **The Archives** | The central repository of all missions and logs. |
| **SQL/Query** | **BMQL** | Beta Max Query Language - the syntax for talking to the core. |
| **Reputation** | **RP** | Currency earned by submitting valid anomalies. |

## The Economy of Quality
In Beta Max, **Reputation Points (RP)** are everything.
*   **Earn RP** by submitting verified Anomaly Logs.
*   **Lose RP** for submitting duplicates, spam, or "features" disguised as bugs.
*   **Rank Up**: High RP grants access to exclusive "Black Operations" (Private Betas).

## Project History (The Pivots)
The road to Beta Max was paved with iteration:
1.  **"Bug Store"**: The MVP. A simple marketplace for bugs. Too transactional.
2.  **"Vanguard"**: Rebranded for "early access". Felt too generic.
3.  **"Apex"**: Introduced the competitive economy. Good, but lacked soul.
4.  **"Vector"**: The shift to "Recon" and "Anomaly" terms.
5.  **"BETA MAX"**: The final form. Fully embraced the retro-future aesthetic and AI-driven interfaces.
